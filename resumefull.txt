With over 20 years of experience in Information Technology, I am a highly driven individual with a diverse background. This has allowed me to expand my skill set, and given me many challenges to improve my personal and technical skills. I have worked with end users, technical engineers, and coworkers to solve many problems. I learn and adapt quickly to new challenges. For the past 3 years, I have managed over 1 PB of data for a large university. I am seeking a full time job where I can utilize my skills and work with great people.
